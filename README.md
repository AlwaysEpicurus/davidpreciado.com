**Showcases Technical Expertise (Cloud, Security, and more)**

Welcome to the repository for **davidpreciado.com**, my personal website. This project showcases my technical expertise, professional skills, and achievements. The site serves as a platform to share insights, projects, and a demonstration of hosting capabilities using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for seamless usability across all devices.
- **Key Sections**:
  - **About Me**: Introducing my background and tagline.
  - **Skills**: Showcasing my technical and professional capabilities.
  - **Projects**: Highlighting notable work and accomplishments.
  - **Contact**: Simple and accessible ways to connect with me.
  - **Oracle Cloud Showcase**: Demonstrating projects hosted on Oracle Cloud.
- **Scalability**: Designed to support multiple domains as the project evolves.

## Updated Project Phases

### **Phase 1: Foundational Setup and Project Showcases**
- Establish the foundational structure for the website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- Deploy the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to Oracle Cloud Object Storage.
- Integrate Cloudflare for DNS management and SSL/TLS configuration.
- Develop a dedicated `Oracle.html` page to highlight Oracle Cloud projects.
- Include descriptions and placeholders for key projects like Oracle APEX apps and Highly Available Web Apps.
- Add static visualizations or descriptive content to demonstrate cloud hosting capabilities.

### **Phase 2: Advanced Multi-Cloud Features**
- Expand hosting capabilities across multiple cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle) using Terraform.
- Implement backend functionality to support dynamic content.
- Demonstrate competency in:
  - **Security**: Configure multi-cloud security policies and best practices.
  - **Containerization**: Deploy containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes.
  - **API Development**: Build and host APIs to connect services across clouds.
  - **Python**: Use Python for automation, backend development, and data analysis.
  - **Multi-Cloud Deployment**: Showcase a hybrid or multi-cloud architecture.
- Explore embedding real-time analytics or dashboards if feasible.

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Usability and Scalability**
- Optimize the user experience with advanced features like search functionality and interactive content.
- Implement additional security measures (e.g., WAF, IAM policies).
- Extend multi-cloud capabilities to include CI/CD pipelines and automated scaling solutions.
- Integrate advanced monitoring tools to track performance across clouds.

## Progress Update

### **Completed Tasks**
- Successfully set up Oracle Cloud Object Storage for hosting the website.
- Configured DNS and SSL/TLS settings using Cloudflare, including:
  - Updated nameservers to route traffic through Cloudflare.
  - Implemented **Full (Strict)** SSL/TLS mode for secure HTTPS connections.
  - Enabled caching and performance optimization features.
  - Added page rules for efficient URL redirection and path management.
- Successfully set up Oracle Cloud Object Storage for hosting the website.
- Created core pages (`index.html`, `about.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html`, and `Oracle.html`).
- Designed the `Oracle.html` page with placeholders for future content and analytics.
- Imported project tasks into Jira for streamlined management.

### **Key Decisions**
- Deferred embedding Oracle Analytics dashboards due to feasibility constraints.
- Prioritized feasibility-based recommendations for future sprints.
